# Code 201: Foundations of Software Development

## Week 4: Project Week

### Overview
Project Week is where students get to stretch out and funnel everything they have learned in the course into building a web application from the ground up. It is a combination of all of the technical pieces (HTML, CSS, JS, Git, GitHub, planning, problem-solving, organization) as well as the collaborative interaction with their teammates that goes into building a project.

There are suggested milestones for each day that have been shown over many iterations to be an effective strategy to keep students on track for completing their projects on time.

### Week 4 Learning Objectives
* Students will design, plan, architect, and build a web application while collaboratively working with their team, as measured by successful completion of the final project by the end of Project Week.
* Students will demonstrate effective use of version control and collaborative coding processes as measured by their successful use of Git and GitHub while completing the team project and as described in the Final Project rubric.
