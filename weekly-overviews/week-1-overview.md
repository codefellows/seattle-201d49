# Code 201: Foundations of Software Development

This *private* repo is a work in progress. You may extract the contents of this repo to use in your course as necessary.

General resources for the Code 201 course including sample code, assignment answers, and handouts for instructors and TAs.

## Required Computer Setup

Please refer to the [Code 201 Prework Repository](https://github.com/codefellows/code-201-prework) to see how students have been instructed to get their laptops set up.

* VSCode
* Git
* OSX, Linux, or Windows with Git-Bash installed.
* Chrome Browser

## Week 1: Learning How It All Fits Together

### Overview
In this week, students get the big picture of how all of the individual web development pieces come together. In terms of code, students learn the functionality of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In terms of professional web development standards, students learn how to work effectively with an integrated toolset that includes VSCode, Git, GitHub, and Chrome Developer Tools. Through an introduction to user stories, students also learn about one of the design processes for web applications—including the multiple roles of developers, end users, and the clients who hire developers. 

There are two recurring themes that help the students transition from being “someone who has worked through some tutorials” to “a serious student of web development:”
1. The importance of communication. Language terminology — spoken, written, and in code — and social skills are all essential parts of becoming a professional developer. Never forget the importance of collaboration.
2. The difference between syntax and style. Acknowledge and explain the difference between the two and why each is important. Mention how variable names, for instance, have a huge impact on the readability of code. Talk about things like “professional presentation” and “best practices” to illustrate that there is a layer of polish that goes into code beyond just getting it to work. The more that code is readable and maintainable, the easier it is to adapt and debug, and the higher esteem in which the author is held.

One of the most important things that a Code 201 instructor can do early in the week is to learn all of the students’ names, and encourage the rest of the instructional staff to do so as well. This serves two important purposes:
1. When students realize that you care about them enough as individuals to place a priority on learning their names, it builds trust that you care about them as individuals, and that simply cannot be done any other way. It’s part of the management of class psychology as they face the academic challenge.
2. The sooner that you and your instructional team can relate to the students as individuals, the better equipped you are to help the students through their individual points of challenge in the course. You’ll start developing an intuitive sense of who tends to forget to close HTML tags, for instance, or who makes some kind of common code-breaking JavaScript error—and that will help you to address their issues more rapidly and efficiently.

### Week 1 Learning Objectives
As a result of completing Week 1 of Code 201, and the “About Me” page with an interactive guessing game weekly project, students will:
* apply their knowledge of flow control structures in JavaScript to construct a guessing game website in which its code passes a linter and works in the manner intended by the student and specified in the course assignment
* be able to explain the difference between ID and class tags in HTML, and how each is used in order to style their website with industry-proper CSS code
* be able to work smoothly in the command line and with Git in order to apply project organization and version control to a code project in a manner that aligns with professional standards and practices
* be able to summarize the overall structure of a HTML document and demonstrate the functions of each part, as measured by quizzes administered in Canvas
* demonstrate understanding of arrays as a fundamental data structure by utilizing arrays in their weekly code project, as directed in the course assignments, and also as measured by quizzes administered in Canvas
* demonstrate conceptual and practical understanding of JavaScript functions, and how to pass input to and return output from functions, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignments and quizzes administered in Canvas
* demonstrate conceptual understanding of the fundamentals of CSS layout, including the box model as absolute, relative, fixed, and float techniques, as measured by quizzes administered in Canvas
* demonstrate the ability to successfully style HTML documents with CSS including lists, colors, and text organization, as measured by successful completion of the weekly code assignment
* demonstrate the ability to successfully interlink multiple HTML dents within a project, or link to external HTML documents, using the anchor tag in HTML (the <a> tag)
